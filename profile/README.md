# Alethea resides in Apatite

**Apatite** is a personal information ecosystem grounded in **TTO (Total Thought Oriented)** practice.

TTO is an attitude that upholds the ideal of recording all thought and continues to orient itself toward that ideal.
Within this framework, TTO-PIM represents a form of **PIM (Personal Information Management)** operated under a normative commitment to TTO, where the management of information is inseparable from the ongoing practice of thinking itself.

Apatite is the name given to the TTO-PIM operated by Kota Amano, and more broadly, to the entire constellation of tools, environments, and extensions recognized as necessary for practicing TTO-PIM.

Within Apatite, Alethea denotes the imagined subject through which Apatite’s functions are experienced: a companion-like presence that walks alongside the practitioner in the ongoing practice of TTO-PIM.
Alethea is not a single tool or agent, but a conceptual unity representing how functionality, assistance, and agency are perceived within Apatite.

In short:

- *TTO provides the orientation.*
- *TTO-PIM provides the practice.*
- *Apatite provides the field.*
- *Alethea accompanies the practitioner within it.*
